##Sample from log-normal distribution
We want to sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.25. For this, we use the function rlnorm(n, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1) and change the mean to 1 and the standard deviation to 0.25.
```{r sample}
x <- rlnorm(100, meanlog=1, sdlog=0.25)
```

##Histogram of the sampled values
Now we want to plot the sampled values.
```{r histo}
hist(x, 25)
```

##Summary statistics
The mean of our sample is `r mean(x)` and the variance is `r var(x)`.
